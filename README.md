## Local Development: Setup and Usage

This project consists of static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. No complex build steps or local server installations are strictly necessary to get started if you plan to edit the files directly.

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1.  **Get the Code:**
    *   **Option A: Fork and Clone (Recommended for customization)**
        1.  **Fork the repository:** First, click the "Fork" button on the [My Resume GitHub repository page](https://github.com/mitesh411/MyResume) to create your personal copy.
        2.  **Clone your fork:** Next, clone your newly created fork to your local machine. Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username in the command below:
            ```bash
            git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MyResume.git
            ```
            This downloads your fork's files to your local machine.
    *   **Option B: Download ZIP**
        1.  Download the ZIP file from the GitHub repository page.
        2.  Extract the files to a folder on your computer.

2.  **Navigate to Project Directory:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and change to the directory where you cloned or extracted the project files:
    ```bash
    cd MyResume
    ```
    (Or the name of the folder you extracted to).

3.  **Customize Your Content:**
    *   Open the project folder in your favorite code editor.
    *   Edit `index.html` (and any other HTML files like `about.html`, `projects.html`, `contact.html` if they exist as separate files) to replace the placeholder information with your personal details (e.g., name, bio, education, experience, project descriptions).
    *   Replace or add images in the designated image folder (e.g., `img/` or `assets/images/`).
    *   Modify CSS files (e.g., `style.css` or files in a `css/` directory) to change the website's appearance, layout, or colors if desired.

4.  **View Your Website Locally:**
    *   Simply open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser (e.g., by double-clicking it or using "File > Open" in your browser).
    *   As you make changes to the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files, save them and refresh the browser page to see the updates.

This method is suitable for quick edits and previewing your resume website without needing any additional tools. For a more robust deployment or to serve the site like a web server, see the Docker instructions below.

## Deployment with Docker

This website can be easily deployed using Docker.

### Dockerfile

The project includes a `Dockerfile` for creating a containerized version of the site using Nginx:

```dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy website files to the Nginx html directory
# This command copies all files from the current directory (where the Dockerfile is)
# into the default Nginx web server directory inside the container.
# Ensure your HTML, CSS, JS, and image files are structured correctly from this root.
COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80 for the web server
EXPOSE 80

# Default command to start Nginx
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

**Explanation:**

*   `FROM nginx:alpine`: Starts from the lightweight official Nginx image.
*   `COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html`: Copies all files from the current directory (where the Dockerfile is) into the default Nginx web server directory inside the container.
*   `EXPOSE 80`: Informs Docker that the container listens on port 80.
*   `CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]`: Starts the Nginx server in the foreground.

### Build the Docker Image

Navigate to the directory containing your `Dockerfile` and website files, then run:

```bash
docker build -t my-resume .
```
This command builds a Docker image and tags it as `my-resume`.

### Run the Docker Container

Once the image is built, you can run it as a container:

```bash
docker run -p 80:80 my-resume
```
*   `-p 80:80`: Maps port 80 of your host machine to port 80 of the container.
*   `my-resume`: The name of the image to run.

You should now be able to access your resume website by navigating to `http://localhost` in your web browser.
